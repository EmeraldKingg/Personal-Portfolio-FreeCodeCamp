# 🌐 Emerald Portfolio

This project is part of my **FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification** — a personal portfolio website that introduces who I am and showcases some of my web projects.  

I designed this page to feel simple, modern, and personal, something that reflects how I’m growing as a developer and creative.

## 💭 Story Behind It

This was one of my favorite FreeCodeCamp projects.  
I wanted it to represent my journey, from learning basic HTML and CSS to building something that feels uniquely *me*.  
It’s not just a project; it’s a reminder of how far I’ve come in tech and where I’m headed next.
